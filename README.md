# üéôÔ∏è ESP32 Work Assistant

Voice-controlled work assistant running entirely on ESP32 with neural networks.

## What it does

- Uses short-time fast fourier transform and machine learning to recognizes voice command for waking up the system
- Uses custom neural network trained on ~2GB of voice data, trained to recognize the word "Marvin"
- Future: After waking up, process audio and send voice commands to clound for identification and execution (Now only replays the sound)

## Hardware needed and wiring

- ESP32 DevKit V1 (160MHz, 520KB RAM)
- INMP441 MEMS microphone (I2S, 24-bit)

## How it works

1. **Audio capture** ‚Üí INMP441 records 24-bit audio
2. **Signal processing** ‚Üí STFT converts to spectrogram
3. **Neural network** ‚Üí 10-layer CNN recognizes wake-up word
4. **Action** ‚Üí Execute work assistant commands (now only plays sound back)
